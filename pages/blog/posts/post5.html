                It's been over six months. I'm preparing for interview. But keep failing and getting rejected.
                So for from January, I attended dozens of virtual interview for MERN developer position.
                Guess what. I failed to secure single offer letter.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When I got graduated in May 2019. Before December 2019 I managed to secure 9 offer letters.
                Some offer are from Tech giants like TCS, WIPRO and IBM.
                But now I can't even secure one offer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                W H Y?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I tried to figure out what was the issue.
                I got more skills. I have years of experience to showoff in resume. And currenty employed at a global tech leader.
                It should be easy right?
                The issue is I'm not consistent.
                Back in 2019, I attended a minimum of 2 to 3 interviews per week. On few days I have attended 3 interview on the same day.
                I attended more interviews therefore I got more offer.
                Moreover I was actively preparing and practicing.
                Which is not the case right now.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Solution:
                Must actively prepare and practice for interview. <br>
                And attend more interviews to improve the change of securing an offer.
