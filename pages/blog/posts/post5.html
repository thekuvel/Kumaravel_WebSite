                It's been over six months since I started preparing for interviews, but I keep facing rejections.
                Since January, I've attended dozens of virtual interviews for MERN stack developer positions.
                And guess what? I haven't secured a single offer letter.

            <p>
                Back when I graduated in May 2019, I managed to secure nine offer letters before the end of that year — 
                some even from tech giants like TCS, Wipro, and IBM. But now, I'm struggling to get even one.

                I've been trying to figure out what changed. 
                I have more skills now. I have years of experience that I can showcase on my resume. 
                I'm currently employed at a global tech leader. It should be easier, right?
                <br>
                <br>
                The issue, I realized, is consistency.
                <br>
                <br>
                Back in 2019, I attended at least two to three interviews every week. 
                On some days, I had three interviews in a single day. 
                The more interviews I attended, the better I got, and the more offers I received. 
                I was actively preparing and practicing — something I haven't been doing lately.

                The Solution?<br>
                Start preparing and practicing consistently again.<br>
                Attend more interviews to improve the chances of landing an offer.
