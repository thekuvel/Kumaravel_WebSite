                Consistency is key when it comes to learning programming and becoming a skilled developer.
                However, the reality is that maintaining consistency is not always possible.
                It's natural to face challenges and experience moments when you feel less motivated.

                It's perfectly okay to take a short break, or even a longer one, when needed. Sometimes, 
                your interest may fade, and that's a part of the process. 
                In fact, over the past three years, I've noticed a pattern when learning something new. 
                I tend to put in a lot of effort during the first two weeks, but gradually my enthusiasm starts to wane.

            <p>
                After a month or so, I find myself not even spending five minutes on it.
                Despite this, I always seem to regain my interest eventually, 
                and the cycle repeats. This experience has taught me that it's normal to have periods of low motivation.

                The key takeaway here is to try your best to stay consistent.
                Yes, you will face challenges, and you might need breaks along the way.
                But if you keep pushing through, the results will come.
                Persistence, even when it's hard, pays off in the end.
