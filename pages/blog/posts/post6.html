                While mastering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is a foundational step in web development,
                it's no longer enough to land even a junior developer position. 
                CRUD showcases your understanding of basic data operations, but real-world applications demand much more than that.
                Hiring managers are looking for developers who can build complete, 
                functional systems—not just forms that interact with a database.

                To truly be job-ready, you need to go beyond the basics. Learn how to integrate payment gateways like Stripe or Razorpay,
                understand and work with advanced database features like MongoDB's aggregation pipeline, 
                and strengthen your problem-solving skills in JavaScript.
                Dive deep into advanced JavaScript concepts such as closures, async/await, event loop, and DB aggregation.
                These skills not only show that you can build dynamic and scalable applications, 
                but also that you understand the inner workings of the tools you're using—a critical distinction that sets great developers apart from average ones.
